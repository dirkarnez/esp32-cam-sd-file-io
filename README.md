====================
### From ChatGPT
> In this updated example, we use two tasks (`task1` and `task2`) to
> perform concurrent writing to the file. Each task acquires the mutex,
> performs the file I/O operations, and then releases the mutex.
> 
> Make sure to include the necessary libraries (`SD.h` and `SPI.h`).
> Adjust the chip select pin (`SS`) to match your specific hardware
> setup. Also, modify the file path (`"/data.txt"`) as per your
> requirements.
> 
> The tasks are created using the `xTaskCreatePinnedToCore()` function
> to run on separate cores of the ESP32 for true concurrency. You can
> adjust the stack size (`10000`) and priority (`1`) of the tasks as
> needed.
> 
> Note that you may need to modify the code further to handle error
> conditions and properly close the file when it is no longer needed.
> 
> This updated example demonstrates concurrent writing to a file on an
> ESP32 with a microSD card using multiple tasks.
